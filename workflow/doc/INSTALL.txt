Installing job-tree.

(1) Place the jobTree dir on your python path. i.e.
PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:FOO/jobTree
where FOO/jobTree is the path to the base directory of jobTree. 

(2) Build the code:
Type make all in the base directory, this just puts some stuff that is currently all python based in the bin dir. In the future there might be some actual compiliation.

(3) Test the code:
	python allTests.py
